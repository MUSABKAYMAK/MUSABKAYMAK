# MUSAB KAYMAK

## Objective

I am a curious individual who likes to utilize data to
understand the roots of financial and sociological
phenomenons and predict future trends. I am a little
fresh to the technical area of data analysis and
excited to see if I can improve enough to create
consistent models that will provide incisive
insights.

## Education

I studied business administration at TOBB University of
Economics and Technology between 2016-2020. I also
studied information management at KU Leuven for a short
period.

## Experience

I did long term internships at an automative company and
a non-for-profit organization throughout college. After
college, I worked in sales, later acted as a general
manager at a furniture company and currently working at
Huntington Bank as a customer experience banker.

## Volunteer Work and Interests

I Like to volunteer my time for organizations working on
helping the less fortunate and I attend several book
clubs every month. I work on promoting intercultural
communication through a volunteer position at a Chicago
based organization. In my free time, I like to play
instruments and go hiking or camping.
